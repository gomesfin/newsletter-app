P# roject Structure
## Setting Up the Project:

- Initialize a new React project using Create React App.

- Install necessary dependencies (react-router-dom for routing).

## Components Structure:

- App Component: Main component where routing and authentication logic will be managed.

- Login Component: Form for existing users to log in.
Signup Component: Form for new users to create an account.

- Home Component: Placeholder for the main content after login.

## Authentication Handling:

- Use localStorage to store authentication tokens or user information after successful login.

- Implement functions to check if a user is authenticated based on localStorage data.

- Create functions to handle login, logout, and signup.

## Routing Configuration:

- Configure routes using React Router:
/ - Home page (only accessible after login)
/login - Login page
/signup - Signup page
/logout - Logout functionality (optional)

## Form Handling:

- Use controlled components in forms to manage user input and form submission.

- Validate input fields (e.g., email format, password length) both client-side and optionally server-side.
